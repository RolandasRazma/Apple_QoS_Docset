<h1>Apple QoS</h1>
</header>
<article>
<p><p>A <i>quality of service (QoS) class</i> allows you to categorize work to be performed by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/operation">NSOperation</a>, <a href="apple:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/operationqueue">NSOperationQueue</a>, <a href="apple:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/thread">NSThread</a> objects, dispatch queues, and pthreads (POSIX threads). By assigning a QoS to work, you indicate its importance, and the system prioritizes it and schedules it accordingly. For example, the system performs work initiated by a user sooner than background work that can be deferred until a more optimal time. In some cases, system resources may be reallocated away from the lower priority work and given to the higher priority work.</p>

<p>Because higher priority work is performed more quickly and with more resources than lower priority work, it typically requires more energy than lower priority work. Accurately specifying appropriate QoS classes for the work your app performs ensures that your app is responsive as well as energy efficient.</p>

<p>The system uses QoS information to adjust priorities such as scheduling, CPU and I/O throughput, and timer latency. As a result, the work performed maintains a balance between performance and energy efficiency.</p>

<p>When you assign a QoS to a task, consider how it affects the user and how it affects other work.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Optimally, run your app at a QoS level of utility or lower at least 90% of the time when user activity is not occurring.</p>

<p>On iPhones, discretionary and background operations, including networking, are paused when Low Power Mode is enabled. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/EnergyGuide-iOS/LowPowerMode.html">See React to Low Power Mode on iPhones</a>.&#39;</p>
